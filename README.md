Version: 0.0.1

Personal Relationship Manaager. A singular resource for keeping track of all personal relationships. Actitivies with dates, details, and so on are all tracked for each individual along with their other personal details. I am mostly building this project for myself, but once I find it in a state where I like it and use it often, I will extend its functionality to make it more usable to others.

Due to the nature of this application, it will purposefully be designed to only work offline until more security measures are in place for keeping users' data private.

### Requirements:
* MongoDB
* Node.js


## Startup process

#### Starting app
* npm app.js
